### - *ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Yoel-Cabaleiro*

  - I'm from [Canary islands](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=canary+islands), Spain. Although I've always been interested in science and technology, my career has not been revolved around these topics. It has been mostly in fundraising for non-profit organizations. I also had a business caring, rehabilitating and training dogs for a time. But all of this is about to change because...
    
### - *ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working as a developer some day.*

  - I always had an interest in programming. The endless posibilities it brings, the room for creativity, the challenge, the logic, the opportunities... It would be great to work in this area, but sadly life didn't allow me to properly learn... until now!. And that's why:

### - *ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Full stack development.*

  - I designed a thorough, conscientious, detailed roadmap. BEHOLD!!:
      - [x] Decide to do it ONCE FOR ALL.
      - [x] Sign up for a bootcamp at [4Geeks Academy](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/index).
      - [x] Give a 110%.
      - [x] Get my Full stack developer certification.
      - [x] Get my first job at programming!!
    
    Easy right?... RIGHT??
